# ‚ùìPROBLEM STATEMENT

Arrange a combination of **6** thin lenses in order to make a high quality image from an object that is **8m** away from the front lens of the camera. 
The distance between the last lens to the image is **15 cm**. The height of the object is equal to **2m** and the image height might be varied from **0.5 cm to 3.5 cm** in order to fit to the physical size of the camera screen.
We will use **sperichal double convex lenses**

# üìù PAPERS & REFERENCES used
We will use the theory and approach of the Flerackers et al. (1984) paper : **Combination of thin lenses-a computer oriented method**. In this paper, the image distances are calculated for up to **3** lenses. We will write a code for finding the image produced from a combination of **6** lenses.

# Explanations



| **Definition**| **Explanation**|
|:-:|:-:|
|**Lens**|Optical Lenses are optical components designed to focus or diverge light. |
|**Double Convex Lens**|Double-Convex Lenses have positive focal lengths, along with two convex surfaces with equal radii|
|**Focal Point**|The point at which all radiation coming from a single direction and passing through a lens or striking a mirror converges|
|**Optical Image**|Optical image, the apparent reproduction of an object, formed by a lens or mirror system from reflected, refracted, or diffracted light waves|
|**Lens Thickness**| An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. A lens whose thickness is not negligible is called a thick lens|
