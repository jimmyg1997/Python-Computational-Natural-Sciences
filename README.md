## Getting Started
The Jupyter notebooks are accessible in various ways

* Online as [static web pages](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org)
* Online for interactive usage with binder
* Local for interactive usage on the user's computer by cloning / downloading the repository from https://github.com/jimmyg1997/Python-Computational-Natural-Sciences
* Other online services (e.g. Google Colaboratory, Microsoft Azure, ...) provide environments for interactive execution of Jupyter notebooks as well. Local execution on your computer requires a local Jupyter/IPython installation.
