## Getting Started
The Jupyter notebooks are accessible in various ways

* Online as [static web pages](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org)
* Online for interactive usage with binder
* Local for interactive usage on the user's computer by cloning / downloading the repository from https://github.com/jimmyg1997/Python-Computational-Natural-Sciences
* Other online services (e.g. Google Colaboratory, Microsoft Azure, ...) provide environments for interactive execution of Jupyter notebooks as well. Local execution on your computer requires a local Jupyter/IPython installation. 


## Concept

[**Natural science**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Natural_science) is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation.  

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: *life science* and *physical science*. Life science is alternatively known as **biology**, and physical science is subdivided into branches: **physics, chemistry, Earth science, and astronomy**.

The present notebooks cover fundamental aspects of **physics, chemistry and biology**. A focus is laid on a mathematical treatise. The discussion of the mathematical background is important to understand the underlying principles in a more general manner.
